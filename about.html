				<h1> PHYSIOLOGY OF A PLANT </h1>
<p>				
Plant physiology is a sub-discipline of botany (study of plant) concerned with the functioning, or physiology, of plants. Closely related fields include plant morphology (structure of plants), plant ecology (interactions with environment), phytochemistry (biochemistry of plants), cell biology, genetics, biophysics, and molecular biology.</p>

A germination rate experiment fundamental processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, plant nutrition, plant hormone functions, tropisms, nastic movements, photoperiodism, photo-morphogenesis, circadian rhythms, environmental stress physiology, seed germination, dormancy and stomata function, and transpiration (both parts of plant water relations, are studied by plant physiologists).</p>

are the same as for all other life forms such as animal, fungi, bacteria, and even viruses. Only the details of their individual molecular structures vary. 
Despites this underlying similarity, plants produce a vast array of chemical compounds with unique properties which they use to cope with their environment. Pigments are used by plants to absorb or detect light, and are extracted by humans for dyes. Other plant products may be used for manufacture of commercially important rubber or bio-fuel. </p> <a href="register.html"> Click here </a>

Plants require some nutrients, such as, carbon and nitrogen, in large quantities to survive. Some nutrients are termed macronutrients, where the prefix “macro (large)”, refers to the quantity needed, not the size of the nutrient particles themselves. Other nutrient, called micronutrients are required only in trace amounts for plants remain healthy. Such micronutrients are usually absorbed as ions dissolved in water taken from the soil, though carnivorous plants acquire some of their micronutrients from captured prey.</p>


		<h2>IMPORTANCE OF PLANT</h2>
<p>
Plants are really important to the plant and for all living things. Plants absorb carbon-dioxide and releases oxygen from their leaves, which Humans and other animals needs to breathe. Living things need plants to live as they are used as food. </p>
